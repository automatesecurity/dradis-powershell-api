# dradis-powershell-api
This script is a rough API client wrapper for Dradis Professional created in PowerShell.  This is an example of what can be done interacting with Dradis programmatically 
via the exposed API.

## First Time Setup
Prior to running, ensure you have provisioned an API token for your user.  Once you have the token, edit the environmental variable placeholder with the token you want to 
use for every API request.  Dradis requires this token within the Authorization header.

Modify the base URL placeholder with your endpoint as well.
